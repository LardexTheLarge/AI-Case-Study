# Viz.ai: Pioneering Stroke Diagnosis and Treatment through AI

## Overview and Origin

In March 2016, the healthcare technology company Viz.ai emerged with one goal - to improve stroke diagnosis and treatment. Founded by two doctors, Dr. Chris Mansi and Dr. David Golan, Viz.ai set out on a mission to enhance the precision and speed of stroke care using cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Their journey from creation to innovation is the result of AI in the healthcare sector.

This case study shows the story of Viz.ai, a company that has harnessed the power of AI to combat one of the most time-sensitive and life-threatening medical conditions. We explore the steps the company took, including securing vital funding from venture capital firms and other investors. Viz.ai's growth began with seed funding, kick-starting their development efforts. In 2017 and 2019, they successfully got two significant Series funding rounds, which not only funded product development but also enabled the expansion of their AI applications for stroke diagnosis and treatment.

## Business Activities

The precise diagnosis and treatment of large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes is the problem Viz.ai is trying to solve. Large vessel occlusions are particularly severe, stemming from blockages in major brain blood vessels. A timely diagnosis is essential in reducing the risk of significant brain damage or even fatality.

Viz.ai serves a diverse range of healthcare professionals and institutions, including neurologists, emergency room physicians, hospitals and healthcare systems, and healthcare providers. Their software is employed by over 1,400 hospitals, signifying a wide-reaching impact on stroke care.

As leaders in AI-assisted stroke care, Viz.ai holds a competitive advantage. Their real-time AI detection, coupled with a mobile platform for remote consultations and scalability for flawless integration into existing healthcare systems, sets them apart.

Viz.ai has harnessed several technologies to address this problem, including AI, deep learning, cloud computing, telemedicine integration, mobile application development, and robust data security measures. These technologies collectively empower Viz.ai to offer rapid and accurate stroke diagnosis, optimizing patient care outcomes. Furthermore, regulatory compliance and data security are important to Viz.ai's operations, ensuring the protection of sensitive patient information and compliance to healthcare rules.

## Landscape

Viz.ai operates within the dynamic field of healthcare technology, where innovation is a driving force. Several major innovations have significantly impacted healthcare in recent years, shaping the way healthcare is delivered, and Viz.ai has emerged as a top company in one of these transformative domains.

One of the most important innovations in healthcare is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning. In the era health, Wearable Health Tech has gained prominence. Wearable devices have the potential to continuously monitor vital signs, encourage wellness, and track patient progress.

In the realm of cutting-edge medical technologies, Viz.ai complements the innovation of 3D Printing. Although they don't directly engage in 3D printing, their AI technologies enhance the precision and accuracy of surgical planning and diagnosis, potentially improving patient outcomes when coupled with 3D printing applications.

Viz.ai's work also intersects with the field of Gene Editing, albeit indirectly. While their primary focus is on diagnostics and care, the data generated through their platform could contribute to genetic research and personalized medicine advancements, where gene editing plays a pivotal role.

Furthermore, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies have the potential to transform medical education, surgical planning, and patient engagement. Viz.ai's commitment to innovation and technology positions them at the forefront of such developments, as they explore the possibilities of AI and real-time diagnostics in conjunction with immersive technologies.

In this diverse landscape of healthcare technology, Viz.ai stands out as a leader in AI-assisted stroke care, with providing timely, accurate, and potentially life-saving solutions. While major tech-related companies like Google Health, PathAI, Zimmer Biomet, and Stryker Corporation have their areas of specialization.
